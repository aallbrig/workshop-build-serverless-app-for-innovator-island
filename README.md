# Workshop: build serverless app for innovator island
This project is based on the instructions for [a workshop by AWS here](https://s12d.com/islandworkshop). Additional links can be found in the resources section.

This is a learning project for me so that I can solidify my serverless application knowledge set.

I enjoy making things more difficult for myself so any manual steps described in the workshop series will be automated. Check out `./scripts/up.sh` and `./scripts/down.sh` to see this effort.
